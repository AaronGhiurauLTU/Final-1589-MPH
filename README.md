# Unity 3D Project Template 2022.3
# based on Jeremy Bond's MSU MI 231 Template

**This project template for all Unity 2022.3 projects in MCS 1243 includes:**
* A Unity project template that includes the correct .gitignore and .gitattributes files to work with GitHub. You won't see the .git___ files because they are invisible, but they help GIT work well with Unity projects.
* **This README.md MarkDown file.** You will need to edit the **Required ReadMe Info** section below for ***EVERY*** project in this class.
* A UnityWindowLayout.wlt file in the project folder (the same folder as this ReadMe.md file) that you can load to lay out the Unity window the way that Peter prefers.
* Modifications to the base Unity project that **remove Plastic SCM**, which is extremely helpful for allowing Git to work well.
